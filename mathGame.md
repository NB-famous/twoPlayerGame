# Planning for two player math Game

## Task 1: Extract Nouns for Classes
- There should be a class called Players 
- The players class should hold the name && lives of player1 && 2
- A Questions class that holds the questions and answers that will be asked of the players

## Task 2: Write their roles
### Players Class
- Players Class should initialize the name and the lives
- must have a method of checking if lives of player is greater or equal to 0
### Question Class
- will have to initialize the question & answers
- a method that checks if its the correct answer or not 
- a method that will create the questions and show them to the terminal(output/puts)

## Notes 

- puts output to the screen (similar to console.log)
- 
- Functions that end with ? in Ruby are functions that only return a boolean, that is, true, or false.
- attr_accessor automatically sets up getters and setters for intance variables
